## Analysis Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to determine whether or not the temperatures in Oahu Hawaii were practical to sustain keeping the surfs up ice cream and surf shop open year round.
  As we had earlier prepared data that we had collected from weather stations around the island into useful datapoints we would begin with that data again. This time however we were going to look at two points in time 6 months appart from each other, we would first review temperatures in June, during the summer months, and then follow those up with a similar analysis on the month of December. We would need to look at all data that we had collected for a multi-year analysis of the average, median, minimum, and maximum temperatures in that region. As this would be multiple years of data it should give us a really good statistical outcome to base our decisions off of.
  
  ## June Results
  To start we formatted all of the collected June data into a list to make it easier for us to view.
